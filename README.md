## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
- [Vuex PersistedState](https://github.com/robinvdvleuten/vuex-persistedstate)

### What I learned

It was my first contact with [Vuex PersistedState](https://github.com/robinvdvleuten/vuex-persistedstate). Basically, this library persists and rehydrates the Vuex state. 
For example, accessing a job's information, since I saved all its information in a state, the data disappeared when refreshing the page. So using this library helped me to maintain the data.
